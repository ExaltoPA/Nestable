Nestable 3
==========

### Drag & drop hierarchical menu editor jQuery plugin

It is a fork from [dbushell/nestable](https://github.com/dbushell/Nestable), with a lot of the improvements introduced by [FrancescoBorzi's Nestable++ fork](https://github.com/FrancescoBorzi/Nestable).

This is still a draft but fully functional. Its purpose is to merge all of the original functionalities, Add/Delete/Edit functionalities (from Nestable++ fork), and add the ability to Export/Import saved menus.

It's not actually intended to be included into existent websites, but more like a standalone software web-app. It is useful for building a menu while thinking about it on a mockup.

## Usage

No need to write any HTML or other code.

Just open the index.html file and build your own menu.

Inspect the [Nestable Demo](https://dbushell.github.io/Nestable/) for guidance of the original Nestable component (created by David Bushell).
